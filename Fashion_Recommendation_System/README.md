# FASHION RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM

A Fashion Recommendation System using Image Features leverages computer vision and machine learning techniques to analyze fashion itemsâ€™ visual aspects (like colour, texture, and style) and recommend similar or complementary products to users.

## Process Flow

1. Assemble a diverse dataset of fashion items. This dataset should include a wide variety of items with different colours, patterns, styles, and categories.
   
2. Ensure all images are in a consistent format (e.g., JPEG, PNG) and resolution.

3. Implement a preprocessing function to prepare images for feature extraction.

4. Choose a pre-trained CNN model such as VGG16, ResNet, or InceptionV3. These models, pre-trained on large datasets like ImageNet, are capable of extracting powerful feature representations from images.

5. Pass each image through the CNN model to extract features.

6. Define a metric for measuring the similarity between feature vectors. 

7. Rank the dataset images based on their similarity to the input image and recommend the top N items that are most similar.

8. Implement a final function that encapsulates the entire process from pre-processing an input image, extracting features, computing similarities, and outputting recommendations.

### Issues Faced during Building this Model

Default import to tensorflow gave TypeError as below

import tensorflow as tf  

<b>Error:</b>

TypeError: Descriptors cannot not be created directly.
If this call came from a _pb2.py file, your generated code is out of date and must be regenerated with protoc >= 3.19.0.
If you cannot immediately regenerate your protos, some other possible workarounds are:
 1. Downgrade the protobuf package to 3.20.x or lower.
 2. Set PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION=python (but this will use pure-Python parsing and will be much slower).

Multiple solutions tried:

1.  Downgraded protobuf to 3.20.x , then 3.20.3 and then 3.20.1 
2.  installed tensorflow 2.9.1
3.  set environment variable in cmd prompt

C:\Users\deept>setx PROTOCOL_BUFFERS_PYTHON_IMPLEMENTATION python

SUCCESS: Specified value was saved.

<b>All the codes started working</b>

Also tried below step it worked

Executed import tensorflow statement in colab - worked
